# Day-14----Bit-Manipulation-in-Java-Programming-Language
ðŸ“… Day 14 - Bit Manipulation in Java Welcome to Day 14 of my DSA Fundamentals Journey. In this module, I dive into the powerful and often underutilized topic of Bit Manipulation using Java. Bit-level operations are crucial for writing optimized and memory-efficient programs, especially in competitive programming and system design.

ðŸ§  What is Bit Manipulation?
Bit Manipulation involves using bitwise operators to perform operations directly on binary representations of integers. These techniques are not only faster but also useful in solving complex problems with simple logic.

ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered:

Binary Representation of Numbers
Bitwise Operators in Java:
& (AND)
| (OR)
^ (XOR)
~ (NOT)
<< (Left Shift)
>> (Right Shift)
Understanding 1's and 2's Complement
Setting, Clearing, Toggling, and Checking Bits
Counting set bits (Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm)
Power of Two Checks
Bitmasking Basics

ðŸ’» Implementations Included:

Check if a number is even or odd using bits
Find the ith bit of a number
Set, clear, and toggle a particular bit
Count number of 1s in the binary representation
Swap two numbers without using a third variable
Detect if a number is a power of 2
Find the only non-repeating element in an array (XOR trick)

ðŸ§© Problem Solving Practice:
Single Number Problem (LeetCode 136)
Find the Unique Element in a Duplicate Array
Hamming Distance
Number of 1 Bits (LeetCode 191)
Subset Generation using Bitmasking
